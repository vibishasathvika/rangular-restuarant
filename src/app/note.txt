       2 state are asyncronuse funtion :reolve state :subscribe()
                                        :reject state   :catch()

      8: data Binding : to share data with in a component
        8.1:one way binding : sharing done in only one direction at appRoutingModule
         => ts(component) to html(view)
              => using string interpulation   -{{ property-name}} in the html page
              =>using property binding  -[attribute-name]="property-name in html
            
         => (view)html to ts(component)
          => Event Binding - (event-name)= "funtion call()"
          =>Event Binding using $event - (event-name)="funtion call($event)"

          8.2: two way binding= sharing only two way direction at a time
